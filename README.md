## Notes

* Why this book? To provide an opportunity to learn HTML and CSS by memorization, if you learn better this way, like to complement other ways of learning HTML and CSS, or want to try it out.

* How to use the book? Read it multiple times, though this is made easier by a lot of repetition in the book. Also, test whether you recall what you read. (The book provides a learning opportunity, it’s not dogmatic in how it’s being used.)

* What is the book _not_? It’s not “the” system for learning HTML and CSS, and it’s not for everyone, either. It’s, again, an opportunity to learn HTML and CSS in a manner that’s not as easy to apply in other books or on other sites.

* Important: This book is boring, this book contains repetition, and you can find all of its information online. (And yet there may be few works as effective as in memorizing key parts of the HTML and CSS.))
