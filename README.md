## Notes

* Why this book? To provide an opportunity to learn HTML and CSS by memorization, if you learn better this way, like to complement other ways of learning, or want to try it out.

* How to use the book? Read it multiple times, though this is made easier by a lot of repetition in the book. Also, test whether you recall what you read. (The book provides a learning opportunity, it’s not dogmatic in how it’s being used.)

* What is the book not? It’s not “the” system for learning HTML and CSS, and it’s not for everyone, either. It’s, again, an opportunity to learn HTML and CSS in a way that’s not as easy to do in other books or on other sites.
