# Introduction

This is one of the most boring books you’ll ever read.

Although an ebook, the book deliberately uses few links. Your mission is to consult the actual, canonical HTML and CSS specifications whenever you have a question or need details. Part of this mission is not to go to other websites—no MDN, no W3Schools, no Stack Overflow (and not the author’s website, either). Make it a habit to study the specifications. Doing so will provide you with the most accurate information and make you a better developer.
