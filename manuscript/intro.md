# Introduction

This is one of the most boring books you’ll ever read.

It contains long lists of HTML elements and attributes, of CSS selectors and properties, as well as complementary HTML and CSS information.

Why bother, why read this book?

Because it provides you with a unique opportunity to learn HTML and CSS, one that isn’t as readily available elsewhere.

Its ambition isn’t to explain all of HTML and CSS to you.

Its goal is to show you the rough, raw skeleton of HTML and CSS, so that you can focus just on that. Elements, attributes, selectors, properties. No explanations, no examples, no context. Just the raw material.

The idea is that even when you only go over the book once, you will already have noticed some things about HTML and CSS that you weren’t aware and that you couldn’t notice elsewhere.

It’s that when you go over the book thoroughly, and indeed memorize the various lists and tables, you’re not an expert web developer (unless you already were one)—but have a solid foundation to build upon.

That foundation—the elements and attributes, the selectors and properties—will then allow you to explore and practice more than you would have been able to, should you have not made the effort to go over the book.

Apart from appreciating the boringness of this book for purposes of becoming a better web developer, there’s one more thing:

Although an ebook, the book deliberately uses few links.

Your mission, from here on, is to consult the actual, canonical HTML and CSS specifications whenever you have a question or need details. Learn the spec URLs by heart, or appreciate weeding out past spec versions and unauthoritative sources from locating the latest CSS modules and editor’s drafts. Make this a habit; study the specifications, always turn to them first. Doing so will provide you with the most accurate information—and likewise make you a better web developer.

Thank you for reading _Rote Learning HTML & CSS_.
