# Introduction

This is one of the most boring books you’ll ever read.

Although an ebook, the book deliberately uses few links. Your mission, from here on, is to consult the actual, canonical HTML and CSS specifications whenever you have a question or need details. Learn the spec URLs by heart, or appreciate weeding out past spec versions and unauthoritative sources from locating the latest CSS modules and editor’s drafts. Make this a habit; study the specifications, always turn to them first. Doing so will provide you with the most accurate information—and make you a better developer.
