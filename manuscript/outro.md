# Conclusion

This is it. However, if you want to get more out of this book, consider [going back to the beginning](#toc-html) and re-reading it.

This is another [reference to the HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#how-to-read-this-specification): The idea behind it is that as a web developer, you benefit from internalizing the specifics of HTML and CSS.

(Even if it couldnâ€™t be more boring.)

Thank you for reading _Rote Learning HTML & CSS_.
