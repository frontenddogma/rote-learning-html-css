# Conclusion

This is it. To get the most out of this book, however, [go back to the beginning](#toc-html), and read it again.

This is a [reference to the HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#how-to-read-this-specification), and you don’t need to read this book “backwards at least once”: The idea is that you won’t regret making efforts to internalize what HTML and CSS have to offer.

(Even if it couldn’t be more boring.)

Thank you for reading _Rote Learning HTML & CSS_.
