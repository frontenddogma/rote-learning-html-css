# Conclusion

This is it—though to get more out of this book, [go back to the beginning](#toc-html) and re-read it.

This is a final [reference to the HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#how-to-read-this-specification): The idea is that you will never regret trying to internalize what HTML and CSS have to offer.

(Even if it couldn’t be more boring.)

Thank you for reading _Rote Learning HTML & CSS_.
