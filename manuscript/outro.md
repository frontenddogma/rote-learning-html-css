# Conclusion

This is it. To get the most out of this book, however, [go back to the beginning](#toc-html), and read it again.

This is a [reference to the HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#how-to-read-this-specification), and you don’t need to read this book “backwards at least once”: The idea is that you will never regret making an effort to internalize what HTML and CSS have to offer.

(Even if it couldn’t be more boring.)

Thank you for reading _Rote Learning HTML & CSS_.
